# Lists

Lists are everywhere - one form or the other. Horizontal, vertical, paginated, infinite..

This Repo seeks to try and explore as many use cases as possible - prioritising optimisation and performance. It won't focus on prettiness, though, but patterns and techniques.

### What we seek to cover?
- Infinite scroll
- Virtual lists
- Paginated lists
- Many more to come...
